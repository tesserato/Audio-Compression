original_audio/violoncello.wav   path to the .wav file to be compressed

10    number of temporal intervals in which the whole wave will be decomposed
4     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the envelope (for each subdivision)

4     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the phase (for the whole wave)

30    number of sinusoids to decompose the wave; roughly, the quality (higher is better)
