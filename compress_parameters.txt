original_audio/voice_bass.wav   path to the .wav file to be compressed

10      number of temporal intervals in which the whole wave will be decomposed
4     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the envelope (for each subdivision)

4     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the phase (for the whole wave)

100     number of basic sinusoids into which the wave will be decomposed; roughly, the quality of the compression (higher is better)
