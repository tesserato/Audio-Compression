original_audio/voice_alto.wav   path to the .wav file to be compressed

30    number of temporal intervals in which the envelope will be decomposed
4     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the envelope (for each subdivision)
1    number of temporal intervals in which the phase will be decomposed

1     number of coefficients to be used in the polynomials describing the phase (for the whole wave)

200     number of sinusoids to decompose the wave; roughly, the quality (higher is better)
