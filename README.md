# Audio-Compression
Physically informed audio compression 


## To do:
- swapped im and real in phase?
- append final error to filenames
- implement "open with"
- problem with framerates (stretching)
- concatenate repeated frequencies
- noise generation
- exclude inaudible frequencies
- rework save format to allocate less disk space to integers
- action in case of error stagnation / increase
- best interval autodetection
